### About Konjay

An entrepreneur, writer, visionary, and success coach.

I begin my spiritual journey in 2013 while on a quest to change my life and become a better person. I begin reading books on personal development and the power of the mind. I studied the lessons of great teachers and sages including Napoleon Hill, Norman Vincent Peale, Wallce T Wattles, James Allen, Louise Haye, Wayne Dyer and many more.

I was on a quest to realize and understand the Power of God. I wanted to know why people acted certain ways, how people are healed, and how miracles happen.

The more I tried getting closer to God, the more I realized God was inside of me and so were all the answers I was so intensely trying to uncover.

Once I realized the power of my mind and how I could harness it for the Greater Good, my mind was set…….I was going to spread positivity and inspiration to everyone and help others WIN in all areas of their lives.
