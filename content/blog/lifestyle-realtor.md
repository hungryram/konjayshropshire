High school may be good preparation for college, and college may be good preparation for finding a job. But neither is very good at preparing you for all of the success in you’ll encounter in your life. The most important ideas and skills for successful, joyful living aren't taught in school. Unless you have an appropriate mentor, this critical part of your education is up to you.

_Consider these secrets to living a successful and enjoyable life:_

## Persistence can be the ultimate power. 

There are plenty of intelligent and talented people who started with nothing. Even if you feel like you were born with the short end of the stick, you can still be incredibly happy and successful with persistence as long as you put the effort in. It’s up to you to make the most of your life.

## You can't control other people. 

With practice, you can learn to control yourself. When you appreciate how challenging it is to control yourself, you'll realize how futile it is to attempt to control others. You can’t change people — only they can change themselves. Invite people into your life that you don't feel the need to change.

## The best investment is the investment you make in yourself.

Spend money to enhance your skills and abilities. Save money for yourself — becoming financially literate may be key. A gym membership or the right books could be the best money you'll ever spend. Most importantly, spend your money on what brings you joy.

## Failing is an essential part of success. 

Those who succeed have failed the most. Accept failure, learn from your mistakes, adjust your process and have another go at it. Don’t give up. Don’t feel guilty. You have to fail to succeed.

## It's important to forgive easily.

 When you forgive others, you set yourself free. Forgiveness doesn't always mean you give the other person a second chance; it means that you're choosing not to suffer any longer. Holding grudges will only bring animosity and negativity into your life. Learn to let go.

## Most of what you worry about will never happen. 

We're all experts at creating catastrophic situations in our minds. We worry and expect the worst. Take a few moments to think about the worst anxieties that have ever been stuck in your head. Most of them never happened. There's plenty of time to get upset after something negative actually happens. Avoid feeling bad before it's justified.

## Quality over quantity is key when it comes to friendships.

Good friends can be hard to find. Those people who say they have 20 close friends probably don’t. Focus on fostering quality relationships instead of making meaningless connections. Getting deep with one person can make a bigger difference than knowing 10 people on a surface level.

## Find a partner who fits into your life rather than trying to build a life around them. 

Suppose you have the life-long dream of spending your winters in San Diego and your summers in the south of France. It doesn't make sense to become romantically involved with someone who insists on living near their family in Oklahoma. Build a life you love and then find someone who fits into your lifestyle. There are more people you could happily spend a lifetime with than you think.

## Find your purpose. 

Imagine having everything you want in life, but spending over eight hours each day at a job you despise. You'll spend a lot of time at work in your lifetime. Make sure you’re doing what you love. If you’re not, consider making a career change.

## Stay in shape, but be kind to your body.

Develop a longterm exercise routine you love that makes you feel good. But when your body needs to rest, that’s productive, too. Life’s too short to count the calories in your breakfast sandwich. Eat intuitively, find purpose in exercise and don’t ever feel shame about resting when you need to.

It's possible to do well in school and still struggle with life. The truth is, you have to experience all aspects of life to find joy in it. No matter how old you are, there’s always something new to learn.
