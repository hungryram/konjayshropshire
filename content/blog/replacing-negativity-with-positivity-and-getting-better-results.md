Sometimes, life sucks. Everything is going wrong, and the inner pessimist is coming out to strike again. Have you ever found yourself in an emotional place where you can't help but focus on the negative?

We’re all human. It happens to the best of us.

Maybe you need a change of mindset. You'll feel so much better when you take steps to be more positive. Plus, you'll get better results.

Ready to take your negative goggles off? Try these strategies to switch that focus:

## **Negative thoughts are inevitable — accept them.** 

Avoid beating yourself up because you experience less-than-positive thoughts. Consider them as being an unavoidable part of your life, but know that you can deal with them. Here’s your little reminder that life isn't perfect for anyone. Despite this, you can still come out strong.

## **Take responsibility for your own thinking.** 

Accept that your thoughts are coming from within you. Sometimes it helps to dig a little, and see where this negative thinking is stemming from.

## **Keep the negativity to yourself.** 

This is a tough one, but now that you've given yourself permission to confront negative thoughts, promise yourself you'll refrain from verbally sharing that negativity with those around you. If you decide to talk to someone about a challenging situation, wait until you have a better handle on your feelings.

## **Record the positive connection to a negative situation.** 

Keep a little notebook or your electronic device close by at all times. When you experience a negative thought about a situation, jot down something positive about it. When you jot down the positives, you can read them later as an exercise to sharpen your disposition in a constructive way.

## **Adopt a new mantra.** 

These simple phrases or words have the power to interrupt negativity. For example: “I am grateful for all that is unfolding in my life and all that is yet to come.” This specific mantra will allow you to practice gratitude in times when you can only see negativity. In a tough situation, try to recite your mantra over and over again.

## **Look ahead to the near future.** 

Maybe you'll discover you’re full of negative thoughts each morning. If so, allow yourself to look two or three hours into the future. Think about a productive day at work followed by a dinner with a loved one. Have something to look forward to each day or week. That in itself may motivate you.

## **Praise your efforts.** 

Once you've experienced your power over your disposition, acknowledge your efforts. You can even reward yourself for motivation to maintain your positivity.

It’s difficult to be stuck in a negative rut. Become aware of these negative thoughts now to deflate this kind of thinking. With experience, you'll see that life is more joyful when you identify and bask in the positives and learn to accept the negatives.
