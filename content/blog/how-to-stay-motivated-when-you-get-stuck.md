Have you ever not seen results right away and given up? Motivation can be hard to come by when you’re not seeing the outcomes you expect or desire. The ability to intrinsically motivate yourself, or to persevere in spite of a lack of motivation, is a valuable skill.

Motivation is frequently in short supply, so learning how to manage yourself through sluggish situations is important.

Doing nothing when you’re lacking motivation is a bad habit that may have negative consequences. There’s a better way of navigating a lack of motivation.

Check out these tips, even when you’re not seeing results:

## **Practice patience.**

 No one wants to be told to be patient. Sometimes, that could make us even less patient. But, it’s important to remember that sometimes, things take longer than we like or think they should. Also you never know — results may show up suddenly after a long period of time.

## **Keep the final result fresh in your mind.**

 When your motivation is waning, remember how you’ll feel when you’re finally successful. Visualize basking in your end goal. Target that moment when you first achieve that goal. Notice how good it feels.

## **Set a schedule and stick to it.** 

It’s normal to start feeling lazy when you lost motivation. One way to combat this is to create a daily plan for yourself. The less motivated you are, the more structure you might need.

## **Learn from your mistakes.** 

Mistakes and failures happen more often than we like, but they’re part of the process. Getting the most out of negative results is a learning experience. If you can adopt the belief that failures are common and can ultimately help you to master your craft, it ’s easier to stay motivated. So, even if you’re failing, see it as life happening in your favor. Everything happens for a reason — mistakes, too.

## **Practice gratitude.** 

Remember that everything is still OK. Try thinking and writing down three things you’re grateful for each day. Journaling these thoughts will help you become more appreciative of life.

## **Take a break.** 

Never feel bad about needing to find a resting point. Just remember, it can be tough to get back on track after a long break. Long breaks can have a way of turning into permanent breaks. Maybe it’s time to take a long weekend and get out of town. Maybe you just need to take a night off and be social. Maybe you need a simple walk in the park.

## **Remember past successes.** 

Your past successes can rekindle your spirit. Reminding yourself that you’ve been successful in the past can renew the hope that you can also be successful now and in the future. Be proud of yourself. Think about a few things that make you feel good about yourself. It puts you in a good mood.

## **Don’t give up.** 

It’s difficult to drop off in the long term if you continue trying. Eventually, you’ll accomplish your objective. However, it’s imperative that you don’t quit. Remember why this dream of yours was ignited in the first place.

Motivation can burn out like a fire, so it’s important to be able to know how to relight your inner flame. Think of the happy dance you’ll do when you achieve your goal. Take breaks as you need them. Remember to be patient and appreciate that good things take time.
