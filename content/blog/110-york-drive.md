You have these huge dreams in mind, you write them down, think about them daily, but don’t really do anything to actually make them happen. It’s OK. It tends to be like that most of the time. Sometimes, it can be hard to just “do the thing.”

Taking action toward your dreams and goals is vital, but clearly, it’s not always easy to stay consistent. However, taking action is one of those important pieces of the puzzle along with proper planning and the drive to succeed. Those who take action are the ones who see results.

How do you motivate yourself to continue working toward your goals, especially when you face challenges? Sometimes, we feel as if our dreams or goals are too “big” to achieve.

Although some strategies will motivate you more than others, it's good to experiment with different ways to find motivation. Then, when the chips are down, you can depend on one of these strategies to get back on track.

Here are some techniques that’ll help you take that next step forward.

## **Break your goals into smaller, attainable steps.** 

Especially if you're working toward a bigger goal, break it up into a series of small steps you know you can achieve. For example, let’s say you’re saving up for a new car and want to make a certain amount of money. Start by budgeting, then chip away at the cost little by little. After each step or milestone, celebrate and reward yourself for a job well done. With small steps, you'll be more likely to stay on task because your rewards come often.

## **Know your limits — you know yourself best.** 

If you move too slowly, you'll know deep down that you could be taking more action. But, when you try to do too much, you could burn out. If your mental health isn’t in the right place, put yourself first, and then start thinking about your goals once you feel like you’re in a better place. Figure out that magic point where you can achieve success without overwhelming yourself, and you'll remain motivated to keep taking action.

## **Eliminate distractions.** 

Yes — get rid of them for as long as you need to. For example, if you're a social person, you might need to stay away from friends and family during the times you want to work. Avoid social media (you’re not missing out — I promise), video games and Netflix when it's time to work.

## **Ask for the help you need it.** 

Don't be afraid to. Type A, individualistic people may not like asking for help, but there’s only so much you can accomplish in one day all by yourself. It's true that sometimes you'll have to accomplish certain things on your own, but if there's any way someone else can help, consider that possibility and ask them. The worst thing they can say is ‘no.’

## **Find an activity that energizes you.** 

Sometimes, you'll find a period in the day when you go into slump mode. Maybe it’s in the morning before you’ve had your coffee, or perhaps it's the afternoon that causes you to feel sluggish. In these times, find some activity to motivate and energize you. For example, try exercising. It'll get your heart rate up and send fresh oxygen to your brain. This’ll refresh you, help you think more clearly and make you feel productive afterward.

## **Keep a tight schedule**. 

An organized schedule will help you stay on track. When you start planning your goals, be very specific when deciding what you need to do and when. This way, when you complete a step, you won't have to spend time figuring out what you're supposed to do next. And, plans can change. What you write down the first day may not be set in stone, but it’s a great starting point.

If you want to succeed, you can do it through purposeful action. Just think about what you've done to accomplish goals in the past. Chances are, you had a plan and followed through. It might not always be easy, but when you stay motivated, you can reach whatever goal you set out to accomplish. You got this.
