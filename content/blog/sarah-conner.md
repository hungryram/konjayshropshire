You've probably experienced many times in your life when you’ve felt tired, overloaded and simply burnt out. You’ve realized you’ve been going through the required motions each day, only to start over again the next morning.

Luckily, there are a number of refreshing activities you can do to bring yourself back to life.

Have you ever thought of utilizing silence to recharge your physical and emotional states? Planning to have some silence in your life every day can be a great way feel renewed. Noise is all around you all the time, and it can still suck away your energy and negatively affect you.

Don’t be afraid of the quiet. Use these strategies to reap the positive effects of peace and quiet and reinvigorate your life:

## Plan a time for silence. 

Thirty minutes is an effective amount of tranquility to experience each day. If you're unsure whether you can sit with peace and quiet for 30 minutes, consider starting out with just 15 minutes and try it for five more minutes each time.

## Ponder how you'll spend your quiet time. 

Activities like browsing a recipe book, reading a novel or scanning the morning newspaper are appropriate ways to spend your time sans noise.

Consider trying some type of meditative experience during these times. 

Sitting and thinking about something that brings you joy is a wonderful way to use your noiseless moments. Recalling the last time you spent with your best friend or thinking about what you want to improve within yourself are also ideal ways to spend this time.

## Engage in muscle relaxation. 

This practice will help you get in touch with your ability to relax during your quiet times. Progressive relaxation, when you alternate between tensing and relaxing each of the muscle groups will dovetail nicely with your episodes of peace. Start at your toes and work up your body to until you reach the top of your head. Take note of how you feel before and after.

## Enjoy the silence. 

Concentrate on the lack of noise. Notice even the smallest sounds of the refrigerator gurgling or the tree branches brushing lightly against the side of the house. Notice the sounds of nature, whether it's wind, rain or frogs and birds chattering to one another. Perhaps these are the sounds you wouldn't normally pay attention to.

## Increase the duration of your times in silence, as you wish. 

When you begin making it a point to experience silence daily, you may be surprised about how much you enjoy it. You'll realize you've been craving the feelings of renewal that only silence can bring.

## Feel free to detach further from your music and the television. 

Being still with just yourself, your thoughts, reading or quiet hobbies will refresh you in ways that other types of rest will not.

Carve some moments out of your schedule on a regular basis to experience the joys and rejuvenating nature of silence. Infusing periods of silence into your everyday life can bring feelings of calm, patience and rest. These moments can also decrease your stress levels and increase your well-being, joy and comfort. Schedule some quiet time today — you’ll be amazed.
