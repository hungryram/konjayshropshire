Non-reaction is a practice that can benefit you and the people around you in numerous ways. Using deep breathing and meditation, you can learn to respond effectively to the stresses in your life instead of overreacting to them.

Non-reaction is important because it stops your negative emotions from running your life. If you practice non-reaction, you'll stay calm in daily stressful situations.

## The Art of Non-Reaction

Non-reaction is the ability to postpone immediate reaction until you've had a chance to consider whatâ€™s actually happening.

Can you remember a time in your life when you snapped at someone in anger, and later had to apologize for your outburst? Your actions didn't represent what you truly meant.

Now, think of a time when something disappointing happened to you, but you withheld reaction until you had a chance to think it over and absorb what was happening. Later, you probably reacted with a calmer and clearer demeanor. This is non-reaction.

The philosophy of non-reaction is simple in theory, but challenging to practice. It's tempting to lose your temper and say what's on your mind at times. Often, you've already reacted before you even have time to consider the meaning of the circumstance you find yourself in. This is where meditation can help you.

## How Meditation Helps

Meditation is a practice that benefits your mind, body and spirit. Meditation can be a simple, yet powerful way to change the way stress affects your life. All you need to do is choose a time to be by yourself and clear your mind. You can meditate sitting, lying down or even by taking a walk. Then, you'll begin to see situations as they truly are.

After practicing meditation for a while, try to bring deep breathing into your everyday life. With practice, you'll learn to meditate as you go throughout the day, and respond to stresses only after contemplating the possibilities with a cool head.

As you practice more and more, you'll notice that you may be controlled by your emotions less and less. Instead of immediate reactions to negative situations, you'll begin to respond calmly and appropriately to each challenge.

### Practice, Practice, Practice

The only way to get the amazing benefits of meditation is to practice as often as possible. Even if you only have a few minutes, try to meditate every day. The more you practice, the better you'll become at mastering your emotions and remaining calm. Schedule a meditation appointment with yourself every day and be sure to keep your appointment. Write down your meditation goals or set a reminder in your phone.

### Staying Stress Free and Reducing Anger

Many people search for years to find a low-cost way of controlling anger and feeling more in control. With meditation, you're always only a few short minutes away from the stress relief you crave. Instead of reacting when you feel angry or upset, you'll begin to seek solutions and feel more confident.

Next time you feel anxiety or anger creeping into your mind, remember that you have a choice. You can react in anger and complicate the situation, or you can respond in a way that encourages you and those around you to seek more effective solutions.

In the meantime, take a few minutes today to breathe deeply, clear your mind of the day's worries and relax. Do the same tomorrow and the next day. The more you do, the better you'll become at non-reaction.
